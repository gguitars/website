# Easy multilanguage deploy

Every single blerb of text should be extracted by a human readable file. Each blerb should have it's own translation. 

When redeploying, we can just edit the text files and upload those.

# Easy asset dump

Do a system for quick asset dump, for example

```
blogposts/post1.md <- just the text
blogposts/post1.jpeg <- pic to attach
```

or, something a bit more elaborate, where the naming scheme and subdirectory structure matters

```
guitars/raffaella/specs.md <- just the text, possibly divided in "specs", "blerb", "name", "etc"
guitars/raffaella/img1.jpeg <- pic to attach
guitars/raffaella/img2.png <- pic to attach
guitars/raffaella/img_preview.png <- pic to attach
guitars/raffaella/img_title.png <- pic to attach
```

...

what else?
