The history from
surf to shoegaze

The Jaguar was initially adopted by surf guitarists just as that fad was running out of wave. Jaguars everywhere began collecting dust until the punk explosion of the '70s and its subsequent mutations took it from relic to iconic.

​

Fender unveiled its Jazzmaster in 1958, 

Although the distinctive guitar-Fender's first offset model-didn’t achieve success on those specific counts, it nonetheless surprised everybody by reaching widespread adoption in other, more unexpected arenas.

Finally as an iconic and versatile guitar for the alternative and indie rock set-a development that continues to see the Jazzmaster in the hands of rock's most inventive musicians.
